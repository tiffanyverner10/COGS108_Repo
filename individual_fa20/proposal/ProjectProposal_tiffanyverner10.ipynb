    "Leash free locations, commonly known as dog parks, are parks that have designated fenced areas for dogs to roam without a lease. These areas allow dogs to socialize and play in a controlled environment. Dog parks keep dogs safe from traffic, kepe them away from harmful objects or areas, and prevent dogs from distrubing other park-goers. Currently, per the City of San Diego website, there are seventeen approved leash-free locations (2). This is in comparison to the number of city parks, which is over four hundred. City parks restrict owners to maintaining their dogs on a leash that cannot exceed eight feet. If owners don't abide with that law and unleash their dogs not in a leash free location, they are at risk of receiving a fine. 

A report from NBC San Diego in 2019 focused on the increase of leash enforcement and ticketing from the San Diego Humane Society (3). Popular parks, such as Kate Sessions in Pacific Beach, are starting to see an influx of citations for off-leash dogs. Owners have expressed that there are not enough dog parks or the current ones in their neighborhood are too small.

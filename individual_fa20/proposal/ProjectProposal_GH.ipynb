    "Leash free locations, commonly known as dog parks, are parks that have designated fenced areas for dogs to run around without a leash. These areas allow dogs to socialize and play in a controlled environment. Dog parks keep dogs safe from traffic, away from harmful objects or areas, and prevent them from distrubing other park-goers. These parks can have special water fountains for the dogs, bags for the owners to clean up after them, and some parks even have lights for the park to be enjoyed at night. Currently, per the City of San Diego website, there are seventeen approved leash-free locations (1). This is in comparison to the number of city parks, which is over four hundred (2). \n",
    "\n",
    "City parks restrict owners to maintaining their dogs on a leash that cannot exceed eight feet. If owners do not abide with that law and unleash their dogs in an area not disclosed for off-leash dogs, they are at risk of receiving a fine. A report from NBC San Diego in 2019 focused on the increase of leash enforcement and ticketing from the San Diego Humane Society (3). Popular parks, such as Kate Sessions in Pacific Beach, are starting to see an influx of citations for off-leash dogs. Owners have expressed that there are not enough dog parks in their neighborhood, or the current ones in their area are too small. In response to the owners' feedback, the Pacific Beach Town Council is working to add an lease free location at Crown Point, but that initiative is still in the works (4).\n",
